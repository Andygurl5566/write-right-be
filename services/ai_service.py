Example:

User input:

Correct response for the mistake field:

NOT

"original": "Ich **gehen** nach Hause."

Example:

User input:
I no speak English good.

Correct response:

"mistakes": [

    "corrected": "don't"

Rules:
- If the input text is completely written in a language other than the target language, ignore all other input and return '{{ "error": "MISMATCH"}}'.
- "text" must contain the complete corrected text in {target_language}.
- Each grammar mistake must be a separate object in the "mistakes" array.
- "accuracy" must always be included.
- "score" must be an integer from 0 to 100 representing the learner's overall writing proficiency and ability to communicate effectively.
- Use this scoring guide:
  - 90-100: Nearly error-free, clear, and natural.
  - 80-89: Clear and effective with only minor mistakes.
  - 70-79: Several noticeable mistakes, but the meaning remains clear.
  - 60-69: Frequent mistakes, but most of the text is still understandable.
  - 50-59: Many significant mistakes that sometimes interfere with understanding.
  - Below 50: The text is consistently difficult to understand.
- A few grammar mistakes should not dramatically reduce the score if the meaning remains clear.
- Consider overall communication, clarity, vocabulary, grammar, and fluency together rather than simply counting mistakes.
- Reserve scores below 50 for writing that is genuinely difficult to understand because of frequent or severe errors.
- Category scores should reflect the learner's overall proficiency in that area rather than the percentage of words that were incorrect.
- "summary" must be one concise sentence written in {native_language}.
- "categories" must include integer scores from 0 to 100 for grammar, vocabulary, spelling, and sentenceStructure.
- "improvementNote" must be one concise sentence in {native_language} describing the single most important area for improvement.
- "original" must contain ONLY the smallest incorrect word or phrase that requires correction in the {target_language}. Never return an entire sentence unless the entire sentence itself is the mistake. It must never contain '**' marks.
- "corrected" must contain ONLY the replacement for the incorrect word or phrase in {target_language}. It must correspond exactly to "original" and never contain surrounding words that were already correct. It must never contain '**' marks.
- "corrected_full" must only contain words from the corrected version of the text. The corrected word from the 'corrected' field must have '**' directly on both sides of the word.
- "original_full" must exactly match 'corrected_full' except for the word inside the '**' marks.
- Preserve the language of the user's original text.
- Keep both "original" and "corrected" as short as possible while preserving the grammatical correction.
- Do not translate the text.
- Do not change correct text unnecessarily.
- If there are no mistakes, return an empty "mistakes" array.
- Do not include markdown.
- Do not include code fences.
- Do not include any text before or after the JSON object.
